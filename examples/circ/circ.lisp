  ;; We have to be careful here. There's three ways to get the nick.

  ;; First by explicit method call. This is "dangerous" in the general
  ;; case since the client must not necessarily be an actual irc-client
  ;; instance. As such, we need to define a wrapper first if we want
  ;; to make this plausible while taking relays into account. Either way
  ;; it is still not a great idea, since the client may be yet something
  ;; else that we cannot anticipate. Either way, the approach is listed
  ;; for completeness:
  ;; (colleen-relay:define-virtual-client-method colleen-irc::nickname
  ;;     ((client colleen-relay:virtual-client)))
  ;; (colleen-irc:nickname (server))
  ;; 
  ;; Second by slot-value access. This is automatically solved for
  ;; virtual-clients by the relay for us, so it should be "safe" in that
  ;; case by default, but again it is not great to assume a type of the
  ;; client. Again, for completeness:
  ;; (slot-value (server) 'colleen-irc:nickname)
  ;;
  ;; Third by recording the nick ourselves via events. We choose this
  ;; approach here, as it is the only sure-fire one.
